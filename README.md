## What Data Does Google Maps Provide?

Google Maps is a treasure trove of valuable business information, making it a popular target for web scraping. To effectively scrape data from Google Maps, it's essential to understand its interface and the key data points it provides.

### Overview of Google Maps' Interface:

When you search for a business or location on Google Maps, the results are displayed in a structured layout. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the interface:

![Google Maps](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/scrape-google-maps/28223e5273e470e175e6c626d4dc6e22.png)

**1. Search Results Panel:**

On the left side of the screen, Google Maps displays a list of businesses or locations matching your search query. Each listing typically includes:
  - **Business Name**: The name of the business or place.
  - **Address**: The physical location of the business.
  - **Phone Number**: Contact information for business.
  - **Ratings**: A star rating based on user reviews.
  - **Number of Reviews**: The total count of reviews left by users.
  - **Category**: The type of business (e.g., restaurant, hotel, retail store).

**2. Info Cards:**

When you click on a specific listing, an info card pops up with more detailed information. This card often includes:
  - **Website Link**: A direct link to the business's official website.
  - **Operating Hours**: The business' opening and closing times.
  - **Popular Times**: A graph showing how busy the location is at different times.
  - **Photos and Videos**: User-uploaded media related to the business.
  - **Additional Details**: Information like amenities, services, or special features.

**3. Map View:**

The right side of the screen displays a map with markers for each business or location. Clicking on a marker also triggers the corresponding info card.

### Identifying Key Data Points:
1. üè¨ Business Names
2. üìçAddresses
3. ‚òéÔ∏è Phone Numbers
4. üåü Ratings and Reviews
5. üåê Website Links
6. ‚è∞ Operating Hours
7. üõí Categories

## Does Google Maps include all business contact details?

No. Google Maps is an ever-expanding free business database: marketers can find place names, addresses, phone numbers, and official websites. However, Google Maps does not provide information on business email addresses or social media accounts.

Fortunately, most businesses list their contact details in one place - their website, which is usually mentioned on their Google Maps details card.

What if you need to contact many businesses at the same time? You must have thought of manually clicking on each card to understand the merchant rating and contact information before making a decision. But you know there are hundreds of similar businesses around you.

How can you quickly complete the collection of contact information and review information? At this time, Google Maps API will help you quickly and accurately obtain all the information!

Below is a sample code snippet that you can directly integrate into your Google Maps Scraper. 

> Python

```Python
import http.client
import json

conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("api.scrapeless.com")
payload = json.dumps({
   "actor": "scraper.google.maps",
   "input": {
      "engine": "google_maps",
      "q": "coffee",
      "type": "search",
      "ll": "@40.7455096,-74.0083012,14z",
      "hl": "en",
      "gl": "us"
   }
})
headers = {
   'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
conn.request("POST", "/api/v1/scraper/request", payload, headers)
res = conn.getresponse()
data = res.read()
print(data.decode("utf-8"))
```

> JavaScript

```JavaScript
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");

var raw = JSON.stringify({
   "actor": "scraper.google.maps",
   "input": {
      "engine": "google_maps",
      "q": "coffee",
      "type": "search",
      "ll": "@40.7455096,-74.0083012,14z",
      "hl": "en",
      "gl": "us"
   }
});

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'POST',
   headers: myHeaders,
   body: raw,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.scrapeless.com/api/v1/scraper/request", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
```

Here you can see the scraping result as:

## FAQs:

### Is it legal to scrape addresses and phone numbers from Google Maps?
Our Google Maps scrapers are ethical and do not extract private user data. They only extract data that businesses choose to share publicly on the web. However, you should be aware that some results, such as reviews, may contain personal data. Unless you have a legitimate reason, you should not scrape personal data.

### Can I extract longitude and latitude from Google Maps?
Yes, every place on Google has a longitude and latitude assigned to it. You can easily scrape these.

### Can I scrape contact details for an entire city?

Of course, you can! If your area has a name (city, state, or country), you can scrape places on Google Maps by just entering the name. But you can also extract data by geographic location (multiple longitude and latitude points).

### Can I scrape restaurant chains and their contact details?
Sure! For example, you can use the search options parameter in Google Maps Scraper to scrape all Starbucks or KFCs in the area. Then, use the Google Maps email extractor to enhance your dataset with all the contact details, as we do in this tutorial.
